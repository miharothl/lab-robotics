Environment has to have clear features and geometric shapes to perform the mapping.
![SLAM 1](https://github.com/miharothl/lab-robotics/blob/master/project-04-map-my-world/images/the-world.png?raw=true)

Robot, explores the world, SLAM in action.
![SLAM 2](https://github.com/miharothl/lab-robotics/blob/master/project-04-map-my-world/images/slam-in-action.png?raw=true)

Explore the mapping database.
